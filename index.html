<!--Craps in Space
        
        "The astronauts have finally made it to space. While they wait for their mission to begin they decide to play a game to pass the time. 
        One of them sugests they play the old world game of craps. He gets out his die and begins to explain the game. If you roll even doubles you win but if you roll 7 or 11 then you lose.
        All other results you roll again. The players place their bets and begin to play the game of craps."
